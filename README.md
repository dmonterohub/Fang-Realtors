# Mock Realtor Website

Fang Realtors is a dynamic, full-stack web application developed by myself and three other teammates at University of South Florida for our senior project.

## Description

This Mock Realtor Website simulates the functionalities of a real estate platform, offering users the ability to browse and search for properties using advanced filters. Built using Python and Django, the application integrates frontend, backend, and database components to provide a comprehensive demonstration of real-world development skills.
